<h1>Steam Comparator</h1>

This project allows a user to enter multiple steam custom profile url and displays their account information and most played game with the time played.

In order to use this application, the user must apply for and get a steam key for themselves here: https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey, then after getting the key right click on the `.gitignore` file and create a new file. Call this file `config.properties` and input your key like this: `steam.api.key = ENTERYOURKEYHERE`
