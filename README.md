<h1>Steam Comparator</h1>

Caleb Langley, Lucas Lehman, Will McRoberts


This project allows a user to enter multiple steam custom profile url and displays their account information and most played game with the time played.

To run this project in command line the user will run the `Main.java` file
If you want to use a GUI then run the `GUI.java` file. Both work with the same idea, enter the steam profile url then press enter to see the stats! When using the GUI the user can either press the enter key or press the Enter All button in the GUI.


In order to use this application, the user must apply for and get a steam key for themselves here: https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey, then after getting the key right click on the `.gitignore` file and create a new file. Call this file `config.properties` and input your key like this: `steam.api.key = ENTERYOURKEYHERE`
